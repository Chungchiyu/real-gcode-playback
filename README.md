# Real G-code Playback

**Real G-code Playback** is an [OrcaSlicer](https://github.com/OrcaSlicer/OrcaSlicer) plugin that adds a **Playback** tab: it plays your sliced G-code the way a printer would print it, in real time.

Each move is timed by a motion planner that models acceleration and cornering. The playback clock is synced to OrcaSlicer's own time estimate, so what you watch lines up with the print time OrcaSlicer reports.

## Features

- Play, pause, step move by move or layer by layer, and scrub a timeline at any speed from 0.01× to 10000×
- Timeline shows layer bands plus markers for filament changes, pauses and heating waits
- Live readout of the current layer, line type, actual vs. set speed, volumetric flow, acceleration and the G-code line being run
- G-code panel: scroll through the whole file; it follows playback, and clicking a line jumps to that moment
- Lines drawn with their actual cross-section from the G-code: scarf seams, Z contouring (Z anti-aliasing), variable-width walls and gap fill show their real width and height
- Colour by line type, actual speed, set speed, volumetric flow, line height, line width, layer time or filament
- Shading options: lit round lines, layer contrast, height shading or flat colours
- Print options: choose bed leveling, flow calibration, timelapse and the other printer flags in Bambu Lab G-code; blocks the printer would skip are not drawn or timed
- Moving-bed view for bed slingers such as the Bambu Lab A1 and A1 mini
- Picks up each new slice when you open the tab, and asks before replacing one you're already viewing
- Pauses when you leave the tab (optional)
- Export: videos (MP4, WebM, GIF) of the whole print, the current layer, a range of layers, the time between two events or any time span, at a chosen speed, size and frame rate; pictures (PNG, JPEG, WebP) of the 3D view or of the whole window with its panels
- Also opens `.gcode` and `.gcode.3mf` files directly

## Install

Requires an OrcaSlicer build with the Python plugin system (releases after 2.4.2, or a nightly).

1. Download [`dist/orca_playback.py`](dist/orca_playback.py).
2. In OrcaSlicer open **Plugins → Install local plugin** and pick the file, then activate it.
3. A **Playback** tab appears in the top bar.

### Recommended setup

In the **Process** settings (Advanced mode), go to **Others → Slicing Pipeline Plugin** and add **Playback capture**. New slices then load with no permission prompts. Bambu Lab printers are captured on every slice; other printers when you export or send.

Without it, **Latest slice** reads OrcaSlicer's temporary G-code instead, and OrcaSlicer asks once for read permission.

## Notes

- Read-only: never changes your G-code or model.
- No network access, and no files written outside the plugin's own folder.
- Exports are saved with the system's Save dialog where OrcaSlicer's page has one (Windows). Elsewhere they go into the plugin's own `exports` folder, and the path is shown after saving. Videos are rendered frame by frame, so their timing is exact however fast the computer is; MP4 uses H.264 when the system has an encoder for it, otherwise VP9.
- No extra Python packages to install.
- Heating time is not counted. Bed leveling counts as 260 s, as in OrcaSlicer's estimate.
- On Linux, OrcaSlicer's plugin sandbox blocks paths containing `conf` (its data folder is `~/.config/OrcaSlicer`), so Playback capture cannot work there; use Latest slice or open a file.

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to make changes. Commit titles follow Conventional Commits (`feat: …`, `fix: …`). **Note:** a push to `main` that changes the version in `src/changelog.json` publishes that version to Orca Cloud (see [Releasing](#releasing)).

```
src/
  core.js        G-code parser and motion planner (no DOM; runs in node)
  app.js         the player: Three.js scene, timeline, HUD, G-code panel, options
  page.html      page layout and styles
  plugin.py      the OrcaSlicer plugin: Pages tab + slicing-pipeline capture step
  changelog.json single source for the version number and the changelog
build.py         assembles dist/orca_playback.py and dist/playback.html
test/            G-code generators, node tests, Playwright tests with a mock `orca` module
```

Build:

```
npm install          # three.js r147 and the export libraries, used only at build time
python3 build.py     # writes dist/orca_playback.py and dist/playback.html
```

`dist/playback.html` is the same player as a standalone page: open it in a browser and drop a G-code file on it.

Test (needs node, Python 3 and `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`):

```
test/run_all.sh
```

## Releasing

The version in the plugin header, the in-app changelog and the plugin's docstring all come from `src/changelog.json`.

1. Add the new version at the top of `src/changelog.json` (and set `"version"` to it), then run `python3 build.py`.
2. Commit, including `dist/orca_playback.py`, and push to `main`.

[`.github/workflows/release-on-push.yml`](.github/workflows/release-on-push.yml) sees that the push changed the version and creates the GitHub release `v<version>` with that version's changelog entry as its notes. Pushes that don't change the version release nothing; commit messages are not looked at. It stops if the version already has a release, is not higher than the latest one, or `dist/orca_playback.py` is not rebuilt. To release a version that was bumped earlier without being released, run **Release on push** by hand from the Actions tab. You can also create a release by hand on GitHub with the tag `v<version>`.

Publishing the release runs [`.github/workflows/publish-orcacloud.yml`](.github/workflows/publish-orcacloud.yml), which finds the commit whose `dist/orca_playback.py` has that version and uploads that file to Orca Cloud as `real_gcode_playback_any.py`. Orca Cloud uses the tag as the version (it must be higher than the published one) and the release notes as that version's changelog; leave the notes empty to use the entry from `src/changelog.json`.

Earlier versions are uploaded the same way: create a release with the tag `v<old version>` on `main`, oldest first, and wait for each run to finish before the next. Orca Cloud only accepts uploads from release runs.

One-time setup: create a fine-grained personal access token for this repository with **Contents: Read and write**, and save it as the Actions secret `RELEASE_TOKEN` (GitHub doesn't start the publish workflow for releases made with the built-in token). In Orca Cloud, open **Edit plugin → GitHub publishing**, enter `Chungchiyu/real-gcode-playback` and click **Connect**; the upload itself needs no secret, because it signs in with a GitHub OIDC token.
